      <h2>«If you are the smartest person in the room, then you are in the wrong room.»</h2>

      <p>I'm an enthusiastic software engineer, who spend most of his time programming in Javascript and Node.js. I'm constantly forward the enrichment of my knowledge and the exploration of new technologies. Moreover, I truly believe in the Open Source philosophy and I will always be passionate about technology, design, music, and cinema.</p>
      <p>Currently, I'm working at <a href="https://elastic.co" target="_blank">Elastic</a>, the company behind Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats and Logstash, as Software Engineer in the Clients teams, and I'm focusing on the JavaScript client.</p>
      <p>I contribute a lot also in various Open Source projects, the one that I'm most proud of is <a href="https://www.fastify.io/" target="_blank">Fastify</a>, a speedy web framework for Node.js. Another noteworthy project is find-my-way, an HTTP router used by Fastify and Restify, the web framework used by Netflix!
      You can find all my Open Source work in my <a href="https://github.com/delvedor" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account.</p>
      <p>I enjoy speaking at conferences, in the past years I've spoken at FullStackCon in London, Nordic.js in Stockholm, Codemotion in Milan, WebExpo in Prague and other amazing conferences and meetups around Europe.</p>

      <p>If you want to contact me, drop me a message on <a href="https://twitter.com/delvedor" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomas-della-vedova/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, and you can find me almost everywhere as <b>@delvedor</b>.</p>
